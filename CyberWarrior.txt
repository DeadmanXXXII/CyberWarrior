If something isn't working check the code parameters, I know there's a lot to do but once done correctly the network/system protects, updates and security tests itself while logging it and prioritizes it all. All alterable parameters have comments to say where and what to do.
Also where ever it says unimplemented! you need to implement your API keys or search logic.
